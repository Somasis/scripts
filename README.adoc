== Components used

:mess: https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2006/01/keeping-your-home-clean-with-mess.html

[small] (unlinked tools can be found in `~/bin`)

.Organizational tools
* `list-{add,color,query}`: tools for managing todo.txt files; I don't like todo.sh that much,
  it feels overengineered, so I have my own I've worked on some. Not really complete, though.
* `mess`: {mess}[a system] for creating temporary, yet archived working directories (a port of
  Leah's original Ruby script, with some additions, is used).

.Desktop tools
* https://invisible-island.net/xterm/[xterm]: my terminal.
  Check `~/etc/X11/xresources` for the configuration.
* https://github.com/lemonboy/bar[lemonbar]: desktop panel.
  See `~/bin/panel-*` for the scripts which make up output displayed on it.
    ** https://github.com/baskerville/xtitle[xtitle]: used for showing window titles.
       One would think `xdotool` could do this, but alas, it can't do everything `xtitle` does due
       to having no way to track window title changes on focused windows, only on focus changing.
* https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm]: tiling window manager
* https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd]: keyboard shortcut daemon.
* https://github.com/google/xsecurelock[xsecurelock]: screen locker with emphasis on high security.
    ** https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock[xss-lock]: integrate locker with suspend events.
    ** See `xsecurelockd` for my setup.
* https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes[unclutter-xfixes]: hide mouse pointer when typing
  and after a timeout.
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst]: notification daemon.

.Desktop theming
* https://typeof.net/Iosevka/[Iosevka]: font family of choice.
    ** However... I currently am using http://people.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~uwe/misc/uw-ttyp0[ttyp0] as
       my main font on a few things, namely xterm and lemonbar. Mainly because of trying to
       establish consistency on account of lemonbar not supporting Xft without a patch, a patch that
       is not currently up to date with the latest version of lemonbar.
* https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme[Arc]: GTK theme of choice.


.Utilities
* https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start[Thunar]: Xfce's file manager, which I tolerate.
* https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[kakoune]: modal text editor integrating with other Unix tools.
* https://skarnet.org/software/execline[execline]: language used for some scripts.
* https://github.com/tmux/tmux[tmux]: terminal multiplexer, which I don't use much given that bspwm
  is almost always enough for me, but I use it for managing my IRC clients and when I'm without
  an X session for some reason.
* https://github.com/leahneukirchen/xe[xe]: god-like xargs alternative.
* https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[rofi]: the most usable dmenu alternative. I don't like it much.
* https://github.com/leahneukirchen/rwc[rwc]: "run when changed".

.Music
* https://www.musicpd.org/[Music Player Daemon].
* https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpdscribble[mpdscribble]: lastfm/listenbrainz scrobbler.
* https://github.com/cdrummond/cantata[Cantata]: Qt5 MPD client.

.Web
* https://www.qutebrowser.org/[qutebrowser]: a web browser using PyQt5 and QtWebEngine.
  Probably the best alternative to the major browsers.
* https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat[newsboat]: RSS reader. I used to like it a lot, I'd like an
  alternative nowadays. Using something like `rss2email` or `sfeed` is predicated on me having a
  mail client I like more, though.

.Mail
* https://aerc-mail.org/[aerc]: mail client.
    ** Buggy, written in Go, and somewhat underdeveloped, but it's not as irritating to configure as
       mutt or neomutt. I don't really like it though.
* https://github.com/leahneukirchen/mblaze[mblaze]: maildir tools, only currently used for showing
  an unread mail count on my panel though...
* http://isync.sourceforge.net/[mbsync]: mailbox synchronizer, propagating changes between remote
  IMAP folders and local Maildirs.

.Chat
* https://discord.com[Discord]: begrudgingly.
    ** With https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord[beautiful-discord], so I can fix the style
       to be more as I'd like (it looks kinda IRC-ish).
* https://git.causal.agency/catgirl[catgirl]: IRC client.
    ** I use the `catgirls` script located in `~/bin` to make it integrate well with a matching
       tmux config and my desktop keyboard shortcuts.
* https://git.causal.agency/pounce[pounce]: IRC bouncer; running on a different machine.
* https://git.causal.agency/litterbox[litterbox]: IRC logger; running on a different machine.
