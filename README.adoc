* https://skarnet.org/software/s6[s6]
* https://skarnet.org/software/execline[execline] - scripting language used for some scripts in
  ~/.local/bin
* https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty[alacritty] - non-VTE based terminal without much cruft
  (in my opinion)
    ** I was at one point interested in trying `st`, but it's a different garbage fire entirely.
* https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm[bspwm] - tiling window manager
* https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd[sxhkd] - keyboard shortcut daemon
* https://github.com/polybar/polybar[polybar] - desktop panel (clock, workspace switcher, window
  titles, system tray, now playing, etc.)
    ** I'd like something simpler, but nothing else seems to have as much usability. I also
       considered lemonbar in the past.
    ** https://github.com/baskerville/xtitle[xtitle] - used as a script module on polybar,
       prints window titles, printing new titles on focus change; one would think xdotool or
       something most people already have would do this, but it doesn't seem so.
* https://github.com/google/xsecurelock[xsecurelock] - screen locker with emphasis on high security
    ** https://bitbucket.org/raymonad/xss-lock[xss-lock] - integrate locker with suspend events
* https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes[unclutter-xfixes] - hides mouse pointer when typing
  and after a period of time
* https://git.causal.agency/catgirl[catgirl] - IRC client
    ** I use the `catgirls` script located in `~/.local/bin` to make it integrate well with tmux and
       my desktop keyboard shortcuts.
* https://git.causal.agency/pounce[pounce] - IRC bouncer; running on a different machine
* https://git.causal.agency/litterbox[litterbox] - IRC logger; running on a different machine
* https://github.com/tmux/tmux[tmux]
* {mess}[mess] - system for creating temporary, yet archived working directories (a port of the
  Ruby script is located in ~/.local/bin)
* https://www.musicpd.org/[Music Player Daemon]
    ** https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpdscribble[mpdscribble] - lastfm/listenbrainz scrobbler
* https://aerc-mail.org/[aerc] - mail client
    ** Buggy, written in Go, and somewhat underdeveloped, but it's not as irritating to configure as
       mutt or neomutt.
* http://isync.sourceforge.net/[mbsync] - mailbox synchronizer, synchronizing between remote IMAP
  folders and local Maildirs.
* https://github.com/leahneukirchen/mblaze[mblaze] - maildir tools, only currently used for the new
  mail count in polybar
* https://github.com/leahneukirchen/rwc[rwc] - "run when changed"
* https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat[newsboat] - RSS reader
* https://github.com/mutinyproject/idioms[idioms] - scripting idioms used throughout ~/.local/bin
* https://github.com/mawww/kakoune[kakoune] - modal text editor that integrates nicely with other
  Unix tools
* https://mkws.sh/pp.html[pp] - preprocessor that calls out to shell
    ** I've considered just switching and learning how to use m4 recently, though. Cuts out a
       dependency.
* https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst[dunst] - notification daemon
* https://github.com/davatorium/rofi[rofi] - the best dmenu alternative
